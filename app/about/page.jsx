          Hi, I am Johnny Calimarri!  I spread joy, laughter and the odd suplex where ever I go.  You may have seen me on my TikTok or my Youtube channel.  Or maybe you have been lucky enought to
          catch me at one of my live a cartoon/movie shows.  I love to watch a cartoon and a movie with some buttery popcorn surrounded by friends.
